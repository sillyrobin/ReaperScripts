This plugin adds white noise to the incoming signal, modulated
by the incoming signal's envelope. The incoming signal is "converted" to noise basically.

I use it on drum tracks, for example a snare that's all overtones and no snare, add this
effect to fill it out with a more full, noisy, sound.

With attack & release settings, a side-effect is that you can also help shape transients.
Increasing release increases sustain for example.

TODO:
  * more types of noise generation
  * more control over the output noise signal
  * allow sending the noise signal to another track
