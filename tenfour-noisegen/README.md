This is just a stereo white noise generator with volume slider.

Modulate "amount" by incoming audio to sprinkle in white noise. I use it on drum tracks
in order to dirty it up. A type of fuzz/distortion.

Some EQ on the noise track

todo:
- bake the signal following into the plugin, so i don't need to bother with mapping to amount
- add incoming signal LP and HP.
