--[[

this script will 

1. position your cursor at the start of a chord within a media item.
2. hold a chord on your MIDI keyboard
3. run this script

The existing notes will be replaced with the ones you're playing.
Original velocities & everything else preserved
If you are holding more notes than were originally held, we insert them.
If you are holding fewer notes than originally, we remove existing ones.
